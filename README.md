## README

The purpose of this project is to analyze the reviews of the most discussed movies on metacritic from the years 2010 to 2018. I will scrape the reviews of both critics and users, and perform some basic NLP on the results to identify any correlations.

- **Note:** I have not included the data along with my jupyter notebook, for that you will have to generate yourself. The file size is rather large, and with the scrapy project found in this repo, you can generate the CSV full of review data for any movie of your choosing.
